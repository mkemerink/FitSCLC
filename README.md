# FitSCLC
Automated open-source model for reliable charge transport analysis in organic semiconductor diodes. The program is written in Matlab and allows automated analysis of temperature-dependent space charge limited conduction (SCLC) measurements on unipolar diodes.

You will need all the Matlab .m files plus the GUI layout ('SCLCfit.fig') to be able to run the program in Matlab. Alternatively, you can use the executable that sits in a zip-archive ('FitSCLC - executable.zip').

In addition, there is an archive containing some sample data ('hole-only sample data.zip') to familiarize yourself with the program and to test any changes you'd like to contribute.

Finally, there is a manual on using the program ('Readme FitSCLC.pdf').

Success!
