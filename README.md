# FitSCLC
Automated open-source model for reliable charge transport analysis in organic semiconductor diodes

There 2 archives, one contains a runtime (executable), the other contains all the Matlab .m and .fig files for advanced users that want to make changes to the code. In addition, there is a manual on using the program ('Readme FitSCLC.pdf') and an archive with some sample data to familiarize yourself with the program.

Success!
